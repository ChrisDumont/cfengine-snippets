Concrete cfengine example snippets

Most cfengine tutorials and examples I've found concentrate on presenting some part of the cfengine language. And they
practically always work with trivial target files or goals. Don't get me wrong: these examples are necessary to learn cfengine.
But, I often find they're hard to transform into something that will get real work done. Or, by being too simple they
sidestep real hurdles. I hope you'll find the ones here useful.
